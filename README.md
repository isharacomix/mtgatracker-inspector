# MTGATracker: Inspector

## Getting started

How to run Inspector locally:

1. Get dependencies: `npm install .`
1. Start the local server `gulp dev`
1. Make code edits, gulp automatically reloads on save

Note that babel takes 30-60s to transpile and pack the app's js. Be patient, and generally wait
for the second "Finished 'dev' after 55ms..." output after changing source files.
